=== Introduction
Hi there!

=== Features
- State transitions validation.
- State-scoped validations.
- State-scoped lifecycle callbacks (before|after_save, etc)
- ???????
- PROFIT!!!11
As a bonus you get multiple conditions in <tt>:if|:unless => [:one, :two, ...]</tt>
callback and validation options (as in edge Rails).

=== Installation
  gem install pipa-statelogic --source http://gems.github.com

Installable as a plugin too.

=== Example
    class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
      ...
      statelogic :attribute => :state do # +:state+ is the default value, may be omitted
        # you get methods +unpaid?+ and +was_unpaid?+.
        # may be more than one initial state.
        initial_state 'unpaid' do
          transitions_to 'ready', 'suspended' # won't let you change to wrong states
        end
        state 'ready' do # you get +ready?+, +was_ready?+
          transitions_to 'redeemed', 'suspended'
          validates_presence_of :txref # scoped validations
          before_save :prepare_for_plucking # scoped callbacks
        end
        state 'redeemed' do # likewise
          transitions_to 'suspended'
          validates_presence_of :txref, :redeemed_at, :facility_id # scoped validations
        end
        state 'suspended' do # you guess
          transitions_to 'unpaid', 'ready', 'redeemed'
          validate do |order|
            order.errors.add(:txref, :invalid) if order.txref && order.txref !~ /\AREF/
          end
        end
      end
      ...
    end

    order = Order.new
    order.state = 'wtf'
    order.txref = 'orly'
    order.valid? # Please note that state transition checks are done during
                 # the validation step as well, and the error is added to
                 # the model's +errors+ collection on the state column and
                 # will appear on your form. Standard ActiveRecord's error
                 # message +:inclusion+ is used. Override it with Rails i18n
                 # for something more specific if it's to be displayed to user.
