    class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
      ...
      statelogic do
        # you get methods +unpaid?+ and +was_unpaid?+.
        # may be more than one initial state.
        initial_state 'unpaid' do
          transitions_to 'ready', 'suspended' # won't let you change to wrong states
        end
        state 'ready' do # you get +ready?+, +was_ready?+
          transitions_to 'redeemed', 'suspended'
          validates_presence_of :txref # scoped validations
          before_save :prepare_for_plucking # scoped callbacks
        end
        state 'redeemed' do # likewise
          transitions_to 'suspended'
          validates_presence_of :txref, :redeemed_at, :facility_id # scoped validations
        end
        state 'suspended' do # you guess
          transitions_to 'unpaid', 'ready', 'redeemed'
        end
      end
      ...
    end
